		Introduction to DevOps !!!
		
		Fundamentals of DevOps :::
		
		Software ?	--> Collection of Programs
		
		Software / Application ?
		
		Types of Applications ?
			- Desktop Application
			- Web Application
			- Mobile Application

		Software Development Life Cycle - (SDLC)
			- Requirement Analysis
			- Design 
			- Code/Development
			- Testing 
			- Deployment/Implementation
			- Maintainence/Monitor


		Waterfall Model - Is linear in fashion/Top-Down Approach
						
			E_Commerce Portal 		==> 9 Months to complete this proj.
			Project 1: Core
				- Requirement Analysis		10 func. +2 Func
				- Design 
				- Code/Development
				- Testing 
				- Deployment/Implementation
				- Maintainence/Monitor		
			
			Project 2: Enhancement
				- Requirement Analysis		10 func. +2 Func
				- Design 
				- Code/Development
				- Testing 
				- Deployment/Implementation
				- Maintainence/Monitor		

		Agile Methodologies :::::

			Using Agile Methodologies we can achieve :::
			
				- Continuous Development
				- Continuous Integration
				- Continuous Testing
				- Continuous Delivery
						--> Continuous Delivery - Is a process of Releasing the software product to Production Environment
												- This requires Manual intervension/Manual Approvals for Production Release.
				
			But, We can't achieve :
			
				- Continuous Deployment :
						- Is a process of Releasing the software product to Production Environment
                        - This doesn't requires any Manual intervension/Manual Approvals for Production Release.
						
						
						
		DevOps ::::
		
			Is a software Development Strategy, which helps to promote the collaboration between the teams like Development Team & Operations Team to achieve Continuous Development, Continuous Integration, Continuous Testing, Continuous Delivery, Continuous Deployment and Continuous Montoring, - in more automated fashion.
			
		Teams :::
		
		SDLC 
		
			- Infra-Structure Management Team 
			- Application Development Team
			- Testing Team 
			- Release Management Team
			- Production Support Team
			- Production Monitoring Team
			- Security Team
			
		
		Environments :::
		
			Non-Prod Environment(Server/VM/Infra-Structure)										Production Environment
			
				- Dev Environment
				- Testing Environment
					QA - Quality Assurance 
					UAT - User Acceptance Testing 						========>					Prod Environment	
				
		
		DevOps Stages ::: / DevOps Tools ::::
		
		
			Infra-Structure Management :::
					Infra-Structure Provisioning/Creating servers	---> Terraform 
					Infra-Structure Configuration					---> Ansible
		
		
			Continuous Development
				---> 		It is the capability of the Dev Team to Continuously Develop/Code the application.
				Developers ???
				
				- Code the application :::
						IDEs - Integrated Development Environment - Eclipse based IDEs/ Visual Studio Code / Visual Studio / Pycharm 
						GIT/Jenkins
				
				- build the application -- Is the process of Compiling the source code & Create Artifacts(Binaries)
					Maven/Gradle/Ant
				- Unit Testing 
				- Deploy the changes for further Testing - 
				- Send the Notifications to Testing Team 
			
			Continuous Integration
				---> 		It is the capability of the Dev Team to Continuously Integrate the changes for further Testing 
							Jenkins/Docker/Kubernetes/Ansible
				
			
			Continuous Testing
				---> 		Perform Automated testing using some testing tools like TestNG/Selenium, Jenkins 
				
			Continuous Delivery / Continuous Deployment   -- Jenkins/Docker/Kubernetes/Ansible
				---> 		Both Continuous Delivery / Continuous Deployment  process are used to release the changes to production.
					Continuous Delivery ==> This needs manual intervension/Manual Approvals for Production Release
					
					Continuous Deployment ===> Starting from Build till production release everything is automated without any manual intervension
			
			
			Continuous Montoring
				--->		Is used monitor the Applications/Infra-Structure
									Prometheus/Grafana/Nagios/Splunk/Dynatrace....
									AppDynamics
		
		
		
		DevOps Tools :::
		
			Self-Managed Tools ::
				Open Source Tools 
				 git,jenkins,docker/kubernetes/ansible/terraform
						
			Managed Services/Tools 
				Paid Tools 
				
		
		How to Implement DevOps ::::
		
			Based on the Application Architecture ::::
			
				Monolith Application Architecture :::
					It is Tightly coupled application.	
				
				Micro-Service Based Application Architecture :::
					It is loosely coupled Application.
					Each function/Module is considered a service.
					Each service can be independently developed and deployed to prod envirnment.

		Tele-Comm Service Provider2 --> Introduce New Offer to their customers --> 
		
		
			DevOps -->
			
				Continuous Delivery --> Downtime 
				Continuous Deployment 
		
		
			Production Release Activities ::::
			
			
		Banking :::

			Online Banking Service 
			Online Credit-Card Service 
			
				Continuous Delivery --> Downtime 
				
					Production Deployment Window --> 4hrs to 6 Hrs. - DownTime 
							1. It is not working as expected!
									- Fix that issue. 
									- Revert the changes.

		DevOps is all about :: 
			People / Process / Tools
								

				- DevOps Team :::
				
					- Infra-Structure Management Team 
					- Application Development Team
					- Testing Team 
					- Release Management Team
					- Production Support Team
					- Production Monitoring Team
					- Security Team		
					
					
			Is a software Development Strategy, which helps to promote the collaboration between the teams like Development Team & Operations Team to achieve Continuous Development, Continuous Integration, Continuous Testing, Continuous Delivery, Continuous Deployment and Continuous Montoring, - in more automated fashion.
			
			
			DevOps Team ::::
			
				DevOps Associate / Sr. DevOps Asso. /DevOps Engg. / Sr. DevOps Engg. /DevOps Leads / Sr. DevOps Leads / DevOps Architects /DevOps Consultant / SRE.....
				
			1. Detailed DevOps Assessment.
			2. Give Recommendations.
			
			
				Ultimately, DevOps is implemented to achieve Continous Improvement for longer run!

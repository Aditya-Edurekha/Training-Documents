		Introduction to DevOps !!!
		
		Fundamentals of DevOps :::
		
		Software ?	--> Collection of Programs
		
		Software / Application ?
		
		Types of Applications ?
			- Desktop Application
			- Web Application
			- Mobile Application

			E_Commerce Portal --> www.amazon.com
			
		Software Development Life Cycle - (SDLC)
			- Requirement Analysis
			- Design 
			- Code/Development
			- Testing 
			- Deployment/Implementation
			- Maintainence/Monitor


		Waterfall Model - Is linear in fashion/Top-Down Approach

			Project 1: Core
				- Requirement Analysis		10 func. +2 Func
				- Design 
				- Code/Development
				- Testing

				- Maintainence/Monitor		
			
			Project 2: Enhancement
				- Requirement Analysis		10 func. +2 Func
				- Design 
				- Code/Development
				- Testing 
				- Deployment/Implementation

			Using Agile Methodologies we can achieve :::
			
				- Continuous Development
				- Continuous Integration
				- Continuous Testing
				- Continuous Delivery
						--> Continuous Delivery - Is a process of Releasing the software product to Production Environment
												- This requires Manual intervension/Manual Approvals for Production Release.
				
			But, We can't achieve :
			
				- Continuous Deployment :
						- Is a process of Releasing the software product to Production Environment
                        - This doesn't requires any Manual intervension/Manual Approvals for Production Release.
						
						
						
		DevOps ::::
		
			Is a software Development Strategy, which helps to promote the collaboration between the teams like Development Team & Operations Team to achieve Continuous Development, Continuous Integration, Continuous Testing, Continuous Delivery, Continuous Deployment and Continuous Montoring, - in more automated fashion.
			
		Teams :::
		
		SDLC 
		
			- Infra-Structure Management Team 
			- Application Development Team
			- Testing Team 
			- Release Management Team
			- Production Support Team
			- Production Monitoring Team
			- Security Team
			
		
		Environments :::
		
			Non-Prod Environment(Server/VM/Infra-Structure)										Production Environment
			
				- Dev Environment
				- Testing Environment
					QA - Quality Assurance 
					UAT - User Acceptance Testing 						========>					Prod Environment	
				
		
		DevOps Stages ::: / DevOps Tools ::::
		
		
			Infra-Structure Management :::
					Infra-Structure Provisioning/Creating servers	---> Terraform 
					Infra-Structure Configuration					---> Ansible
		
		
			Continuous Development
				---> 		It is the capability of the Dev Team to Continuously Develop/Code the application.
				Developers ???
				
				- Code the application :::
						IDEs - Integrated Development Environment - Eclipse based IDEs/ Visual Studio Code / Visual Studio / Pycharm 
						GIT/Jenkins
				
				- build the application -- Is the process of Compiling the source code & Create Artifacts(Binaries)
					Maven/Gradle/Ant
				- Unit Testing 
				- Deploy the changes for further Testing - 
				- Send the Notifications to Testing Team 
			
			Continuous Integration
				---> 		It is the capability of the Dev Team to Continuously Integrate the changes for further Testing 
							Jenkins/Docker/Kubernetes/Ansible
				
			
			Continuous Testing
				---> 		Perform Automated testing using some testing tools like TestNG/Selenium, Jenkins 
				
			Continuous Delivery / Continuous Deployment   -- Jenkins/Docker/Kubernetes/Ansible
				---> 		Both Continuous Delivery / Continuous Deployment  process are used to release the changes to production.
					Continuous Delivery ==> This needs manual intervension/Manual Approvals for Production Release
					
					Continuous Deployment ===> Starting from Build till production release everything is automated without any manual intervension
			
			
			Continuous Montoring
				--->		Is used monitor the Applications/Infra-Structure
									Prometheus/Grafana/Nagios/Splunk/Dynatrace....
									AppDynamics
		
		
		
		DevOps Tools :::
		
			Self-Managed Tools ::
				Open Source Tools 
				 git,jenkins,docker/kubernetes/ansible/terraform
						
			Managed Services/Tools 
				Paid Tools 
				
		
		How to Implement DevOps ::::
		
			Based on the Application Architecture ::::
			
				Monolith Application Architecture :::
					It is Tightly coupled application.	
				
				Micro-Service Based Application Architecture :::
					It is loosely coupled Application.
					Each function/Module is considered a service.
					Each service can be independently developed and deployed to prod envirnment.

		Tele-Comm Domain ::::
		Tele-Comm Service Provider1 --> Introduce New Offer to their customers --> 
		Tele-Comm Service Provider2 --> Introduce New Offer to their customers --> 
		
		
			DevOps -->
			
				Continuous Delivery --> Downtime 
				Continuous Deployment 
		
		
			Production Release Activities ::::
			
			
		Banking :::

			Online Banking Service 
			Online Credit-Card Service 
			
				Continuous Delivery --> Downtime 
				
					Production Deployment Window --> 4hrs to 6 Hrs. - DownTime 
							1. It is not working as expected!
									- Fix that issue. 
									- Revert the changes.

		DevOps is all about :: 
			People / Process / Tools
								

				- DevOps Team :::
				
					- Infra-Structure Management Team 
					- Application Development Team
					- Testing Team 
					- Release Management Team
					- Production Support Team
					- Production Monitoring Team
					- Security Team		
					
					
			Is a software Development Strategy, which helps to promote the collaboration between the teams like Development Team & Operations Team to achieve Continuous Development, Continuous Integration, Continuous Testing, Continuous Delivery, Continuous Deployment and Continuous Montoring, - in more automated fashion.
			
			
			DevOps Team ::::
			
				DevOps Associate / Sr. DevOps Asso. /DevOps Engg. / Sr. DevOps Engg. /DevOps Leads / Sr. DevOps Leads / DevOps Architects /DevOps Consultant / SRE.....
				
			1. Detailed DevOps Assessment.
			2. Give Recommendations.
			
			
				Ultimately, DevOps is implemented to achieve Continous Improvement for longer run!

			deployment ==> It is a process of copying the artifacts from one envirnment to another.
			
			Version Control System Using GIT.
			
			
			Development Phase ::
				Jsp/html/*.java
				
				
			index.html 		--> save as a flat file.
			<html>

			--adfasdfas-
			-adfasf
			-sd
			-fasdfa
			-sdf
			-asdfsdfsa
			-asdfsdfsaa
			asdfas

			</html>
			
			Version Control System ::::
			
			index.html_v1.0 		--> Tags/Version/Commit_Id
			index.html_v1.1
			index.html_v1.2
			
			Types of Version Control System :::
			
			Local VCS
			Central VCS 
			Distributed VCS -- GIT 
			
				- GIT is open source Distributed Version Control System 
						- It is used to Version Control the source Code Changes 
						- It is used to Track the Changes 
						- It is used to perform Parallel Development
						
			Install GIT and Manage GIT 
			
			- GIT File Workflow
			
			Git Misc. Command 
			
			GIT Branching Strategies
			Handle Remote Repositories
			
			Repository - Collection of Files & Folders .
			
			
			GIT File Workflow :::
			
			
			Local Machine 																		Remote Server 
			
			Working Dir.		Staging/Index Area			  Local Repo.								Remote Repo.
			 file1.java ------->	file1.java 	  ----------> file.Java			==========>					file1.java
						git add					  git commit					git push
			
			
			git clone 	==> It is used to clone/copy the entire remote repo. into Local Machine.
			
			git add 	==> It is used to add the changes from Working dir. to Staging Area 
			
			git commit 	==> It is used to commit the changes from staging area to Local Repo.
			
			git push 	==> It is used to Push the changes from Local Repo. to Remote Repo.
			
			
			git fetch/git pull ==> Both are used to handle incremental changes from remote repository.
			
			git fetch 	==> It is used to check if there is any incremental changes present in remote repo.
							If there are any changes exist, The incremental changes will be updated only the local repo.
			
			git pull 	==> It is used to check if there is any incremental changes present in remote repo.
							If there are any changes exist, The incremental changes will be updated in the local repo. as well as in the working dir.
							===> git fetch + git merge
			
			
			git fork 	==> It is used to copy from one remote repo to another remote repo.
			
			Developers' WorkLoad ::
			
				Enhancement/Bugfix Project
				
				New Project 
			
			
			Lab Requirements ::::
			
			
				Install GIT and Manage GIT 
				
				Local Machine -- Install Git Cli
				
				Remote 		  -- Github 
				
				1. Create an Account in Github.  https://github.com/
